# Logging

Python code uses the standard `logging` module of python, so it can be configured according to [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

Set `RUST_LOG` environment variable according to [env_logger docs](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging) in order to see logs from rust modules.

To run an example with trace level logging for rust modules:
```
RUST_LOG=trace uv run examples/path/to/my/example
```
