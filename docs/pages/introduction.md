Cherry is a python library for building blockchain data pipelines.

It is designed to make building production-ready blockchain data pipelines easy.

## Getting Started

See [getting started section](https://steelcake.github.io/cherry-docs/getting_started.html) of the docs.

## Features

- Pure `python` library. Don't need yaml, SQL, toml etc. 
- High-level `datasets` API and flexible pipeline API.
- `High-performance`, `low-cost` and `uniform` data access. Ability to use advanced providers without platform lock-in.
- Included functionality to `decode`, `validate`, `transform` blockchain data. All implemented in `rust` for performance. 
- Write transformations using `polars`, `pyarrow`, `datafusion`, `pandas`, `duckdb` or any other `pyarrow` compatible library.
- `Schema inference` automatically creates output tables. 
- Keep datasets fresh with `continuous ingestion`.
- `Parallelized`, next batch of data is being fetched while your pre-processing function is running, while the database writes are being executed in parallel. Don't need to hand optimize anything.
- Included library of transformations.
- Included functionality to implement `crash-resistance`.

## Data providers

| Provider            | Ethereum (EVM) | Solana (SVM)  |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview) | ✅ | ❌ |
| [SQD](https://docs.sqd.ai/)             | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Yellowstone-GRPC](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc) | ❌ | ✅ |

## Supported output formats

- **ClickHouse**
- **Iceberg**
- **Deltalake**
- **DuckDB**
- **Arrow Datasets**
- **Parquet**

## Usage examples

- [**Ethereum(EVM)** examples](examples/eth)
- [**Solana(SVM)** examples](examples/solana)

## Logging

Python code uses the standard `logging` module of python, so it can be configured according to [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

Set `RUST_LOG` environment variable according to [env_logger docs](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging) in order to see logs from rust modules.

To run an example with trace level logging for rust modules:
```
RUST_LOG=trace uv run examples/path/to/my/example
```

## Development

This repo uses `uv` for development.

- Format the code with `uv run ruff format`
- Lint the code with `uv run ruff check`
- Run type checks with `uv run pyright`
- Run the tests with `uv run pytest`

Core libraries we use for ingesting/decoding/validating/transforming blockchain data are implemented in [cherry-core](https://github.com/steelcake/cherry-core) repo.
